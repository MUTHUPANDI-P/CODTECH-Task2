# **Building a Serverless Application with AWS Lambda**

This project demonstrates the creation of a serverless application using AWS Lambda. The goal is to provide an understanding of serverless computing and how to build applications without the need to manage servers.

## **Project Description**

In this project, you will learn how to create a serverless application on AWS through the following steps:

### **Create an AWS Lambda Function**

1. **Log into the AWS Management Console.**
2. **Navigate to the AWS Lambda service.**
3. **Click on "Create function" and choose "Author from scratch."**
4. **Provide a function name and choose a runtime, such as Node.js, Python, etc.**
5. **Configure function permissions by creating a new role with basic Lambda permissions.**
6. **Click "Create function" to create the Lambda function.**

### **Write and Deploy the Lambda Function Code**

1. **In the Lambda function's code editor, write your function code.**
2. **You can also upload a .zip file or use an S3 bucket for larger deployments.**
3. **Configure the function's handler and runtime settings as needed.**
4. **Click "Deploy" to save and deploy the function.**

### **Set Up API Gateway**

1. **Navigate to the API Gateway service in the AWS Management Console.**
2. **Click on "Create API" and choose "HTTP API" or "REST API" based on your requirements.**
3. **Create a new API and configure the routes and methods (GET, POST, etc.).**
4. **Integrate the API with the Lambda function by specifying the Lambda function ARN.**
5. **Deploy the API and note the endpoint URL.**

### **Test the Lambda Function via API Gateway**

1. **Use tools like Postman or cURL to send HTTP requests to the API endpoint.**
2. **Verify that the Lambda function is triggered and responds correctly.**

### **Monitor and Optimize**

1. **Navigate to the CloudWatch service to monitor the Lambda function's performance.**
2. **Check logs, set up alarms, and optimize the function's performance based on insights.**

## **Technologies Used**

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
  - **Lambda**
  - **API Gateway**
  - **CloudWatch**

## **Conclusion**

This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding the basics of serverless computing with AWS Lambda. It covers essential skills in writing, deploying, and managing serverless functions, serving as a valuable resource for anyone looking to explore serverless architecture.
